# emacs-nepali-romanized

Emacs input method for Nepali with romanized Nepali keyboard layout of Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya, Nepal (or now, of [Language Technology Kendra](http://ltk.org.np/keyboard_layouts.php)).

Load `nepali-romanized.el` file from your `.emacs` file. Then you should be ready to go.

See [emacs-wiki-input-methods](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InputMethods) if you need help in setting/switching different input methods.

Select `nepali-romanized` to select this input method. You can use `C-h I method RET` to see the layout.


The keyboard mapping with the unicode is adapted from the one present at: https://github.com/suvash/nepalify/blob/master/lib/nepalify.js
